# Meteor-Madness-Space-Axolotls

**Project Overview and Functionality**

This project is an interactive simulation and visualization platform composed of **two main sections**:

1. **Orbiting Objects Section:** This part connects in real-time to **NASA's Asteroids - NeoWs API** to retrieve data on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) like asteroids and comets. It processes this information to model their orbital trajectories and calculates the probability of impact.
2. **Collision Simulation Section:** This allows users to run a hypothetical impact scenario. They can configure key variables such as the **impact location** on Earth, and the asteroid's **size, density, and velocity**. Based on these parameters, the system simulates and visualizes the physical consequences:
3.
   * The size and depth of the crater.
   * The energy released, equivalent to megatons of TNT.
   * Devastating side effects such as **earthquakes and tsunamis** generated by the impact.

**Benefits and Intended Impact**

* **Benefits:** It translates complex astronomical data and physics principles into an **easy-to-understand visual experience**. It offers a memorable and interactive learning tool, superior to static teaching methods.
* **Intended Impact:** The main goal is to **foster public interest in science**, astronomy, and the importance of planetary defense. We seek to raise awareness about the risks of asteroid impacts in a tangible way, by showing the magnitude of these events and justifying the need for detection and monitoring programs.
